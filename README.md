# Simply Svelte

Simply Svelte is a quick-start template I've designed to speed up the development of my freelance projects. Realizing others might find it just as useful, I decided to share it. It comes equipped with a carefully selected range of packages, utilizing an opinionated tech stack to offer a streamlined and consistent development experience.

## Tech Stack

- **Svelte**: A lightweight modern JavaScript framework for building user interfaces.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A highly customizable, low-level CSS framework that provides you with all the building blocks you need for bespoke designs.
- **SASS**: A robust CSS preprocessor used in conjunction with Tailwind to establish consistency across classes using mixins.
- **TypeScript**: A typed superset of JavaScript, adding static types for increased development safety.
- **Vite**: A next-generation front-end tool that offers a significant boost to your development experience.

The chosen tech stack is extremely versatile and can efficiently cater to projects of any size. However, I specifically find Svelte to be exceptional for small to medium-sized projects. The Simply Svelte template makes it easy to hit the ground running with a practical boilerplate that includes minimal yet logical SASS mixins and useful default components, such as form inputs, navbars, and footers.

## Customizable & Versatile

Simply Svelte is easily customizable to your specific needs and adaptable to any file structure you prefer. It serves as a robust starting point for your project, accommodating your unique development patterns effortlessly.

## Quick Start

To get started with Simply Svelte, clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```
git clone https://github.com/cwooldridge1/simply-svelte.git
cd simply-svelte
yarn install
```

Then, run the development server:

```
yarn dev
```

## Consistent Color System

In this template, I've incorporated a Bootstrap-like color system (e.g., `bg-success`) to maintain visual consistency across your projects. If you'd like to modify the default colors, you can adjust them in both `tailwind.config.js` and `_variables.scss`.

## Contributions

I wholeheartedly welcome contributions to the project! If you have suggestions, improvements, or bug fixes, please feel free to make a pull request or open an issue.

Simply Svelte is a labor of love designed to provide a fast and efficient way to kickstart your projects. It offers a hand-picked set of packages and a tech stack proven to be effective for small to medium-sized projects. I hope you find this template as useful as I do.
